## FairTriEdge-FL: Federated, Fair, and Explainable Multimodal Edge Intelligence for Real-Time Emergency Department Triage

### Project Goals

The primary goal of FairTriEdge-FL is to develop a novel real-time triage decision support system that is:
*   **Federated**: Enables collaborative model training across multiple institutions without sharing sensitive patient data.
*   **Fair**: Ensures equitable performance across diverse patient demographics and hospital sites.
*   **Explainable**: Provides human-readable rationales for triage decisions, potentially enhanced by Large Language Models (LLMs).
*   **Multimodal**: Integrates various structured data types (e.g., vital signs, symptoms, patient history).
*   **Edge-Intelligent**: Deploys models on local hardware for low-latency, real-time inference and on-device adaptation.
*   **Robust**: Defends against data poisoning attacks in federated settings.
*   **Clinically Relevant**: Improves accuracy, reduces bias, and enhances workflow in emergency department triage.

### Project Phases

The project will be structured into the following major phases:

#### Phase 1: Data Preparation and Simulation Environment Setup
*   **Objective**: Establish a robust data foundation and a simulated multi-site environment for federated learning.
*   **Technical Choices**:
    *   **Synthetic Multi-Site Data Generation**: Utilize generative modeling to create realistic synthetic triage datasets mimicking diverse hospital populations (e.g., pediatric-heavy, varying disease prevalence). This allows explicit control over distribution shifts for stress-testing generalizability and fairness audits.
    *   **Domain Adaptation Strategy**: Implement techniques like transfer learning (pre-training on base data, fine-tuning on synthetic "new site" data) to learn site-invariant features and improve generalization.
    *   **Continuous Drift Monitoring**: Develop a data drift detection module using statistical alerts (e.g., Population Stability Index, concept drift detectors) to monitor incoming data for shifts and trigger model recalibration.
*   **Deliverables**:
    *   Synthetic multi-site triage datasets.
    *   Data generation and simulation scripts.
    *   Initial data drift detection prototype.

#### Phase 2: Core Model Development and Optimization
*   **Objective**: Design and develop the primary multimodal triage prediction model, optimized for edge deployment.
*   **Technical Choices**:
    *   **Multimodal Fusion Architecture**: Design a deep learning model (e.g., using recurrent neural networks for temporal vital signs, feed-forward layers for static/categorical data) with an attention mechanism or gating network for fusion.
    *   **Resource Optimization (TinyML)**: Employ model compression techniques (quantization, pruning, knowledge distillation) to ensure efficient execution on edge hardware, targeting sub-100ms inference latency and low CPU usage.
    *   **Personalization Mechanisms**: Embed personalization by allowing the model to adjust predictions based on individual patient factors (age, comorbidities) or learn from repeated visits/baselines via fine-tuning on local data.
*   **Deliverables**:
    *   Initial multimodal triage prediction model.
    *   Benchmarking of model performance vs. latency/resource usage.
    *   Optimized model for edge deployment.

#### Phase 3: Federated Learning and Robustness Integration
*   **Objective**: Implement and evaluate the federated learning paradigm, incorporating privacy and robustness features.
*   **Technical Choices**:
    *   **Simulated Multi-Node Training**: Partition the single-hospital data into virtual clients (e.g., by department, time period, or patient subgroups) to simulate federated training.
    *   **Privacy Preservation**: Adhere to FL protocols where only model updates (not raw data) are shared. Explore differential privacy (adding noise to gradients) if feasible.
    *   **Poisoning Defense**: Implement robust aggregation techniques (e.g., Krum algorithm, coordinate-wise median) to mitigate malicious or corrupted client updates.
    *   **Communication Efficiency**: Employ strategies like model update compression and asynchronous update handling to minimize bandwidth requirements.
    *   **Fairness in Federated Models**: Monitor model performance across client data to detect bias and explore fairness-aware FL algorithms (e.g., adjusting client weights, equalizing performance).
*   **Deliverables**:
    *   Federated learning framework prototype.
    *   Demonstration of robust aggregation against simulated poisoning attacks.
    *   Initial analysis of fairness metrics in the federated setting.

#### Phase 4: Explainable AI (XAI) and LLM Integration
*   **Objective**: Develop and integrate explainability features, including LLM-enhanced explanations and synthetic case generation.
*   **Technical Choices**:
    *   **Built-in XAI**: Integrate techniques like SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) or rule-based models to highlight feature contributions to predictions.
    *   **LLM-Enhanced Explanation Module**: Explore using a fine-tuned medical LLM to generate concise, natural language rationales for triage decisions based on key factors identified by the core model.
    *   **Synthetic Rare Case Generation**: Utilize LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-conditioned) to generate synthetic Boolean records for stress-testing rare shock, pediatric, or toxicology patterns, augmenting training data and enabling audit.
    *   **Real-Time Interpretability of Boolean Rule Chains**: Research methods (e.g., Boolean Rule Column Generation) to extract and present simplified logical rules approximating the model's decision boundary in real-time.
*   **Deliverables**:
    *   XAI module providing feature importance.
    *   LLM-generated explanations for triage decisions.
    *   Synthetic rare case generation capability.

#### Phase 5: Comprehensive Evaluation and Open Science
*   **Objective**: Rigorously evaluate the system's clinical efficacy, usability, ethical implications, and ensure transparency and reproducibility.
*   **Technical Choices**:
    *   **Clinical Validation**: Plan for prospective or retrospective replay evaluation against real patient outcomes and expert judgments, measuring accuracy, under/over-triage rates, and impact on ED flow.
    *   **Usability and Workflow Integration**: Conduct mixed-methods usability assessments with triage nurses and physicians (surveys, interviews, observations) to gather feedback on trust, ease-of-use, and workflow impact.
    *   **Ethical and Bias Analysis**: Analyze model performance across patient subgroups (age, gender, ethnicity) and convene an ethics panel for consultation. Implement audit logging for all AI decisions.
    *   **Performance Benchmarks**: Benchmark against existing methods, using proper validation techniques (cross-validation, hold-out sets) and statistical rigor.
    *   **Open Science Practices**: Commit to open-sourcing core model code and synthetic data, following reporting guidelines (TRIPOD-ML, CONSORT-AI), and publishing Model Cards.
*   **Deliverables**:
    *   Comprehensive evaluation report (technical, clinical, ethical).
