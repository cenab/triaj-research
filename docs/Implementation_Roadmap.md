# Implementation Roadmap: Making TODO Functionalities Work End-to-End

This document outlines the specific steps needed to implement all the placeholder "TODO" functionalities identified in the codebase to achieve a fully working end-to-end system.

## 1. Prerequisites and Environment Setup

### 1.1 Install Required Dependencies

```bash
# Core ML and data science libraries
pip install alibi-detect shap opacus tensorflow-privacy scipy scikit-learn eli5 aif360

# LLM API libraries
pip install openai  # For OpenAI API (fallback)

# Additional utilities
pip install torchmetrics  # For MMD loss implementation
```

### 1.2 Fix Existing Warnings

**File: `data_preparation.py`**
