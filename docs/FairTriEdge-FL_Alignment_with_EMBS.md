# Alignment of FairTriEdge-FL with IEEE EMBS Scope and Novelty Expectations

## Overall Fit to IEEE EMBS (EMBC) Scope and Novelty

The proposed study "FairTriEdge-FL: Federated, Fair, and Explainable Multimodal Edge Intelligence for Real-Time Emergency Department Triage" aligns strongly with the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) themes. We estimate an ~85% fit with EMBS, especially the EMBC conference scope. EMBS and EMBC emphasize cutting-edge applications of AI, networking, and devices in healthcare, and this proposal touches multiple active areas (federated learning, edge computing, clinical decision support, explainable AI, and ethical AI). The breadth of topics is very much in line with EMBC's multidisciplinary focus. The study's focus on real-time clinical decision support (ED triage) and privacy-preserving learning across institutions resonates with EMBS's interests in digital health and biomedical informatics. Each component of the project (federated learning, on-device inference, fairness, XAI, etc.) has appeared in recent EMBS publications, indicating good topical overlap (detailed below). Overall, the project appears highly relevant and novel for EMBC's audience, though the true novelty will be judged by how these components are integrated and validated. We assign ~85% fit as a strong match, with minor caveats (e.g. some aspects like LLM-based explainability are very new and less proven in EMBS literature). In summary, FairTriEdge-FL is well within EMBC's scope, likely to be seen as timely and innovative, provided the contributions are clearly distinguished from prior work.

## Topic Overlap with Recent EMBS Publications

- **Federated Learning (FL) & Privacy:** Significant EMBS interest in FL for healthcare in the past 5 years. Special issues and multiple papers in JBHI and EMBC on FL for privacy, multi-hospital modeling, and robust FL. FairTriEdge-FL's FL component (with privacy and poisoning defense) is directly in line with EMBS's recent focus. Novelty comes from combining FL with fairness and adversarial resilience in a new clinical context (ED triage).
- **Edge AI and On-Device Inference:** Edge computing for real-time inference and privacy is a growing EMBS topic. EMBC and JBHI have highlighted edge AI for IoMT, wearables, and 5G. FairTriEdge-FL's on-device adaptation and inference in the ED overlaps with these trends. Novelty is in demonstrating a full real-time triage system running on edge hardware.
- **Emergency Department Triage Models:** Few EMBS papers on ED triage, but related work on prehospital triage and risk prediction. FairTriEdge-FL's focus on ED triage using structured data is a fresh and important application. Novelty is in improved accuracy, fairness, and explainability beyond existing triage tools.
- **Explainable AI (XAI) and LLM-Based Explainability:** XAI is increasingly important in EMBS, but LLM-based explainability is very new. FairTriEdge-FL's use of LLMs for explanations and synthetic case generation is pioneering. Novelty is in moving from feature importance to rich, human-readable explanations.
- **Fairness and Ethics in AI:** Fairness and ethics are emerging topics in EMBS. FairTriEdge-FL's explicit focus on fairness and audit aligns with these trends and fills a gap in practical solutions for bias mitigation in clinical AI.

## Prior Work Overlap in IEEE EMBS Literature

- **Federated Learning in Multi-Center Healthcare:** Prior EMBC/JBHI work on FL for imaging and EHR prediction, but not for ED triage or with fairness/adversarial robustness.
- **Secure & Robust FL (Poisoning Attacks):** Security of FL addressed in JBHI (e.g., multi-key schemes), but FairTriEdge-FL integrates robust aggregation and anomaly detection in a clinical triage context.
- **IoMT, Edge Computing, and On-Device AI:** Edge AI for health is a recurring EMBS topic, but few works demonstrate a full edge AI triage system.
- **Clinical Triage Prediction Models:** Some JBHI/EMBC work on triage prediction and risk scoring, but FairTriEdge-FL adds federation, fairness, and explainability.
- **Explainable and Fair AI in Healthcare:** XAI and fairness are discussed in EMBS, but LLM-based explanations and fairness-driven FL in triage are new contributions.

## Gaps in the Literature Addressed by FairTriEdge-FL

- **Integrated Multimodal Edge Intelligence for Triage:** First to integrate multimodal data, edge deployment, and federated training for ED triage.
- **Federated Learning Applied to ED Triage Data:** First to apply FL to structured clinical triage data, addressing data silo and privacy issues.
- **Fairness and Bias Mitigation in Clinical AI:** Explicitly targets fairness and bias mitigation in triage, providing new solutions for equitable AI.
- **LLM-Based Explainability and Synthetic Cases:** Pioneers LLM-generated explanations and synthetic data for triage, filling a gap in XAI and data augmentation.
- **Holistic Evaluation (Technical + Clinical + Ethical):** Plans a thorough evaluation including clinician and ethics audit, setting a benchmark for comprehensive assessment.

## Risk Factors for Novelty and Scope Fit

- **Incremental vs. Integrative Novelty:** Novelty lies in integration; must highlight unique synergy and any new techniques.
- **Breadth vs. Depth (Scope Creep):** Broad scope risks shallow treatment; prioritize and thoroughly evaluate primary innovations.
- **Validation Concerns (Synthetic Data & Simulation):** Synthetic data may weaken real-world impact; clinician validation is crucial.
- **Novelty of "Multimodal" Aspect:** Clarify what multimodal means in this context to avoid overreach.
- **Overlap with Prior Art:** Clearly delineate innovations beyond prior work.
- **Complexity of Implementation:** Ensure all promised features are delivered; focus on core results for EMBC, expand for JBHI.

## Suitability for IEEE EMBC vs. JBHI: Venue Assessment

- **EMBC 2025 Recommendation:** FairTriEdge-FL is an excellent fit for EMBC. The conference values innovation and relevance, and the project's interdisciplinary nature and real-time clinical demo aspect are strengths. EMBC is ideal for unveiling integrated prototypes and gathering feedback.
- **JBHI Suitability:** With additional depth and rigorous validation, the study could target JBHI. The journal expects thorough comparison to alternatives, extensive experiments, and clear methodological advances. EMBC first, then JBHI with expanded results, is the recommended path.
