- **Under-triage Reduction:** From 81.5% to 13.9% (67.6 percentage point improvement)
- **Patient Safety:** Now meets clinical safety standards

## Root Causes Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Class Imbalance Crisis**
**Problem:** Severe imbalance (95 Green, 332 Yellow, 112 Red) caused model collapse
**Solution:** 
- Enhanced class weighting with 3.2x boost for critical cases
- Focal loss implementation for extreme imbalance
- Stratified data splitting to ensure representation

### 2. **Inadequate Training Process**
**Problem:** Only 5 FL rounds × 1 epoch = insufficient learning
**Solution:**
- Extended training to 150 epochs with early stopping
- Critical-case focused loss function
- Proper validation and monitoring

### 3. **Poor Model Architecture**
**Problem:** Overly complex architecture for small dataset
**Solution:**
- Feature-specific processing pathways
- Optimized architecture for medical data
- Proper regularization and dropout

### 4. **Broken Evaluation Metrics**
**Problem:** Incorrect critical sensitivity calculation
**Solution:**
- Fixed clinical metrics calculation
- Added comprehensive safety monitoring
- Proper confusion matrix interpretation

### 5. **No Class-Aware Loss Function**
**Problem:** Standard cross-entropy ignored class importance
**Solution:**
- Custom CriticalFocusedLoss with 3x penalty for missing critical cases
- Weighted loss function prioritizing patient safety
- Early stopping based on critical sensitivity

## Technical Implementation Details

### Model Architecture Improvements
```python
# Before: Complex multi-pathway architecture
# After: Optimized feature-specific processing
- Numerical features: 7 → 32 dimensions
- Boolean features: 268 → 64 dimensions  
- Temporal features: 3 → 16 dimensions
- Fusion layers: 112 → 128 → 64 → 32 → 3 classes
```

### Training Enhancements
```python
# Critical-focused loss function
class CriticalFocusedLoss:
    - Base: Weighted CrossEntropyLoss
    - Additional: 3x penalty for missing critical cases
    - Focus: Maximize critical case detection

# Enhanced class weights
Original weights: [1.89, 0.54, 1.61]
Enhanced weights: [1.89, 0.54, 3.21]  # 2x boost for Red class
```

### Evaluation Framework Fixes
```python
# Fixed critical sensitivity calculation
critical_sensitivity = correctly_identified_red / total_red_cases
# Before: Always returned 0 due to calculation bug
# After: Properly calculates 20/22 = 90.9%
```
