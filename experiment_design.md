# Experiment Design: Advancing Triage with LLM, ML, Edge Intelligence, and Federated Learning

## Objective
To design and evaluate a next-generation triage (triaj) system that leverages:
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Traditional Machine Learning (ML)
- Edge Intelligence
- Federated Learning

## Motivation
- Improve accuracy, speed, and personalization of triage decisions.
- Ensure privacy and data sovereignty by processing sensitive data locally (Edge Intelligence).
- Enable collaborative model improvement across multiple sites without centralizing data (Federated Learning).

## High-Level Experiment Plan
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Use your existing triaj dataset.
   - Simulate or use real-world distributed data sources (e.g., multiple hospitals or clinics).

2. **Model Architecture**
   - Combine LLMs (for unstructured text, patient notes, etc.) with ML models (for structured data, vitals, labs).
   - Deploy lightweight models on edge devices for real-time inference.

3. **Federated Learning Setup**
   - Each site trains models locally on its own data.
   - Periodically aggregate model updates on a central server (or via decentralized protocols).
   - Ensure privacy via differential privacy, secure aggregation, or similar techniques.

4. **Edge Intelligence**
   - Deploy models on edge devices (e.g., hospital workstations, mobile devices).
   - Evaluate latency, reliability, and offline capabilities.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Triage accuracy (e.g., correct risk stratification)
   - Latency (time to decision)
   - Privacy (data never leaves local site)
   - Model improvement over rounds

6. **Experiment Phases**
   - Baseline: Centralized ML/LLM
   - Edge-only: Local inference, no collaboration
   - Federated: Collaborative learning across sites
   - Hybrid: LLM+ML, Edge+Federated

## Next Steps
- [ ] Detail the dataset and preprocessing steps
- [ ] Specify model architectures (LLM, ML, Edge)
- [ ] Design federated learning protocol
- [ ] Define evaluation protocol
- [ ] Implementation plan
